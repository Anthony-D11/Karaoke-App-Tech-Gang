We created a karaoke app to allow users to sing to their favorite songs. Our app allows users to make
playlists and then add their favorite songs to them. Since it is a karaoke app you need to be able to sing.
So, we have a record function. This allows the user to choose a song from their device as well as lyrics (in
a text file). Once you choose the song and lyrics and re click the record button it will play the song and
lyrics (if it was chosen) and record your voice. For best quality use headphones. After you stop the
recording, you can name the song. If itâ€™s the first song you record it will create a new playlist called
records and add it there. If its not then it will automatically be added to record folder.
